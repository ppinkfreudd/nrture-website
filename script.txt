Turning Social Reviews into CX Delightors
TITLE: Turning Social Reviews into CX Delightors & Augmenting ROI
Sub-line: “Improve ROI — One Review at a Time”
THUMBNAIL: “Millions of Social Reviews. Zero Replies?”

00:00 – 00:15 | Hook / Problem
VO: “More travellers than ever decide where to eat, drink or shop by reading reviews. Yet airports, F&B concessionaires, and lounges face millions of social reviews every year - over 80–90% go unanswered. Every ignored comment is a missed CX moment and a silent leak in ROI.
A question worth asking: ‘Whose KPI is it anyway?’”
On-screen text: “Travelers Choose Outlets by Reviews → Unanswered = Lost CX + Lost ROI” Lower-third call-out: “Whose KPI is it?”
Visuals / B-roll:
* Traveler scrolling Google on their phone at the gate deciding where to eat
* Montage of blurred Google stamped “No Reply”
* CX / Ops manager in meeting looking at fragmented dashboards
SFX / Music:
Tense low-beat underscore; soft notification pings; brief record-scratch SFX on KPI line
00:15 – 00:30 | Solution / Mechanism
