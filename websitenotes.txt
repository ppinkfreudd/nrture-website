Elara is your AI Social Reputation Manager - the always-on module that protects your brand voice and unlocks review-driven insights.


Headline “Meet Elara - Your AI Social Reputation Manager”
Powered by tRetail Labs’ research backed CX Delightors’ framework. 
Problem We Solve
* Travellers and diners often decide where to spend based on online reviews.

* Airports, F&B and Lounge concessionaire teams can’t keep up with thousands of reviews across Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.

* Manual replies are slow, inconsistent, and miss service-recovery opportunities.

* Insights trapped in reviews rarely make it into CX strategy.
Our Solution


Elara is your always-on Social Reputation Manager; replying to every review in minutes, highlighting the ones that need a human touch, and feeding leadership a quarterly CX intelligence report. She doesn’t just protect ratings; she uncovers the emotions that drive spending.


Core Capabilities
   1. Auto-Replies 24/7 : Drafts a reply to each review within minutes in a warm, brand-approved tone in any language. Posts after a one-click validation / edit. “Elara drafts, you approve - together delivering a perfect reply in minutes.”

   2. Smart Prioritisation : Flags critical reviews for human attention & service recovery with a set of prescribed action ideas. 

   3. Real-Time Sentiment & CX Metrics : Decodes praise, complaints, emotion drivers across locations. Helps a constant eye on your Social Reputation Score (SRS).

   4. Quarterly CX Intelligence Reports : Benchmarks peer outlets and airports (enhanced competitive intelligence), reveals blind-spots & trends that link emotions to spend with prescribed actions for commercial impact.

   5. Compliance & Brand-Safety : AI guard-rails + human-in-the-loop approvals.

   6. Survey Integration : Combines social reviews & curated tRetail Labs’ CX Delightors surveys for one source of truth.

   7. Scalable Across Locations : Works the same for 5 outlets or 200 airport F&B outlets.
Benefits of Human-Validated Workflow | You are always in control
      * Brand-Safe & Compliant: no risk of tone-deaf or off-brand AI replies.

      * Faster than full-manual: staff review instead of drafting from scratch → response time drops from hours to minutes.

      * Audit Trail: all replies and edits are logged for quality control and governance.

      * Training Loop: every human edit makes Elara smarter for future similar cases. A future feature to train employees is on the pipeline.

      * Customer Trust: travellers see a personal, empathetic response - never a robotic comment.
Why It Matters
         * Protects Reputation: instant, consistent replies show you care.

         * Boosts CX ROI: converts review data into insights that raise guest satisfaction & spend.

         * Saves Man-Hours: replaces the work of a full-time social-response team at each outlet.

         * Early-Warning System: surfaces operational blind-spots before they become crises.

         * Benchmarking: compare peer outlets and airports to drive data-led strategy and operational decisions.
